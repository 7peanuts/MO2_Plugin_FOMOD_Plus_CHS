### Developing

Development of this plugin is done within the context of `mob`.
You'll want to follow all setup instructions for `mob` before proceeding.

1. [Set up mob](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/mob) and all of its requirements.
2. Clone this repository inside the generated `<rootDir>/build/modorganizer-super` directory.
3. Open in your IDE of choice. I prefer CLion and it should be fairly painless.

#### Debugging

To debug:
1. Make sure you are debugging the `fomod_plus` target.
2. Set your target executable to the MO2 executable inside `<mobDir>/install/bin`.
