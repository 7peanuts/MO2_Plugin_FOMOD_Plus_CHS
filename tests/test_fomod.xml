    <Description>This mod retextures the Ancient Nord armor, Ancient Nord Weapons, Nord Hero Weapons, Helm of Yngol, Draugr's armor and CC Fishing's Ancient Nord weapons and Nord hero weapons. I also added an optional mesh replacer to add pants to the Ancient Nord armor. Also contains optional retextures for Legacy of the dragonborn﻿'s Azhidal armor (same as Nordic Wanderer equipments' armor), Gauldur Blackblade, Gauldur Blackbow and Honed Ancient Nord Greatsword of Scorching,  Skyrim Immersive Creatures﻿'s Hoary Nord armor and Yngol's armor, Nordic Wanderer Equipment SSE's Nordic Wanderer armor (same as LOTD's Azhidal armor), Elsopa's Quivers Redone SE's Ancient Nord quiver and Nord hero quiver and a patch for Cathedral Armory. Everything in this is textures only, outside of the optional pants replacer. It is safe to add or remove from your game at any time. I do not touch the Draugr NPCs themselves, only their armor. So it is compatible with any Draugr Retexture / replacer﻿

        The textures for the Ancient Nord armor are based on Cabal120's aMidianBorn Book of Silence﻿. I used their normal maps as a base to create my retexture. Everything else is based on vanilla textures.

        Works with every mod that also works with vanilla textures, such as Heavy armory and animated armory. If you see any major stretching or dark spots when using a mesh replacer, please let me know by linking the mod in the comments and posting a picture of the bugged area (please spoiler the picture to not take too much space) and I will see if I can fix it.

        Fomod lets you pick and choose what you want.

        Textures are 2k except Chest armor textures, which are 4k.

        Half-res version available in Optional files (Chest, weapons and shield are 2k, everything else is 1k)</Description>
